				Before you get to know that how to start competitive programming, first let’s understand what is Competitive Programming and what is the benefit of doing competitive programming.

“Competitive programming” is a mind sport of Computer Programmers that is held over the internet or the local network. In a programming competition, programmers have to write the computer programs for given problems in their reliable language like (c,c++, Java, Python).

			<h2 >Why it is important?</h2>
			<PRE style="font-size:25;font-family:garamond">
Here are some reasons why it is important,
		1. Improves Logic
			Programming logic improves by practice. You are smart from the very beginning. With competitive
			programming, you continuously train yourself with algorithmic problems that test the better out
			of your current logic skills. By practicing more and more you get better and this improves your
			programming logic.
			Makes you more focused and faster
		2. Thinking about a problem and finding its solution makes you more focused. With an improved logic,
			you will be able to think faster, solve problems faster, decide faster and put your thinking and
			solutions into code faster without going to and fro thinking which approach to use for your code.

		3. Helps you solve complicated problems
			In programming contests after easy tasks, you will solve complex tasks which are not for ordinary
			programmers. By doing CP you will learn how to solve these out of the ordinary tasks. This will
			help prepare you for a job because you can adapt and solve various kind of problems in various
			type of situations.

		4. Teaches you how to work in teams
			Working in a team is a very important skill in every field while in software development it is
			more important because most jobs will require you at some point to work in a team. CP helps you
			learn how to effectively work together, as you must work with others on your team to complete
			the same task. In this situation, you will learn how to assess your team member’s strength and
			weakness and effectively divide responsibilities between each other.Additionally, in every company,
			each team have a leader. If you are in a management role within
			a team, then knowing how to organize and motivate your team members is key.

		5. Make you a desirable candidate for major companies
			Participating in CP contests makes you a desirable candidate for big companies. In CP organizer
			websites and companies, these big companies always have a look and they pick the candidates with
			high potential and with the best ability to solve complex tasks. For that, you have to do CP regularly.
			Participate in contests, try to rank higher and build your rating.
